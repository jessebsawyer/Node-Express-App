            | I've been coding on and off for the past couple of years. I love the idea of being able to create something out of thin air with only a laptop... and of course just little bit of coffee! I decided I wanted a career change and enrolled in the Treehouse Tech Degree program, to further enhance my learning.

            br
            | Through the program, I have been able to create applications using Vanilla JS, React, Node.Js and SQL. Outside of Treehouse I have taken additional courses to supplement my learning and to learn more about MongoDB.
            br
            br
            | I am now able to build full stack applications that allow for authentication/authorization, make it easier for customers and employees to access what they need and create an overall great user experience!
